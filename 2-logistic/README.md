## Use Logistic Regression To Estimate Discrete Values (Classification) with Python and Scikit-learn

Despite its often confusing name, logistic regression is a **linear** model that is used for **classification**, or estimating discrete values.

Precision, recall, f1-score, and support are used in the classification report to give a general indicator of how well the model did. More about these variables can be found at http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.precision_recall_fscore_support.html.

We’ll see how to implement logistic regression to estimate discrete values. In this case, we’ll classify images of irises.
