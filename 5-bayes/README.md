## Use Python and Scikit-learn to Implement Naive Bayes To Classify Text 

Weâ€™ll use this probabilistic classifier to classify text into different news groups.

There are several types of Naive Bayes classifiers in scikit-learn. We will be using the Multinomial Naive Bayes model, which is appropriate for text classification. More can be found at http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html.
