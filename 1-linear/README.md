## Use Linear Regression To Estimate Continuous Values (Regression) with Python and Scikit-learn

Linear regression is a linear model that is used for regression.

We’ll use linear regression to estimate continuous values (also known as regression). In this case, we’ll predict house prices in Boston. We'll also look at how to visualize our results with matplotlib, and how to evaluate our models with different metrics for regression problems.
