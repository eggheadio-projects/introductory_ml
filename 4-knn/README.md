## Use K-nearest Neighbors To Find Similar Data Instances with Python and Scikit-learn

Weâ€™ll continue with the iris dataset to implement k-nearest neighbors, which makes predictions about data based on similarity to other data instances, for both classification or regression problems. 


KNN is good for:

-low dimensional data (not too many input variables)

Cons:

-not good for unbalanced data sets
-can be expensive
