## Implement K-means Clustering with Python and Scikit-learn To Find Clusters of Data

Weâ€™ll return to the iris dataset to see how to use k-means clustering, an unsupervised learning algorithm, to create appropriate categories for data.

More on K-means can be found at http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#k-means.
